            Most of the world’s schoolchildren still lack access to the minimum level of 
            physical education, it says in the first-ever Global Status Report on Quality Physical 
            Education. Most of the world’s schoolchildren still lack access to the minimum 
            level of physical education, it says in the first-ever Global Status Report on Quality 
            Physical Education. <br><br>
           <em> The report, “Global State of Play”, by UNESCO’s education department found that 
            58 % of countries have included physical education for girls as mandatory only and 
            that merely 7 % of the world’s schools have introduced boys’ and girls’ equal 
            physical education time. </em> <br>
          <mark>  Two-thirds of secondary and over half of primary students around the world do not 
            receive the minimum weekly physical education. </mark>
            A team expert informed PTI that fewer than one in two primary school teachers 
            have had specialist training in physical education. The team also pointed out huge 
            variations in the funding of physical education across countries – two-thirds spend 
            less than 2 % of their education budget on it and one country in every 10 spends 
            more than 7 %. <br<br>
            “Physical Education (PE) has been the focus of widespread debate among 
            education and health professionals globally because of its potential to enhance 
            learning and contribute to students’ overall development. Professional 
            development opportunities are limited because of lack of funds and/or lack of time 
            in teachers’ schedules to participate in training.”. 
            “For example, just 33 % of nations reported offering in-service training (INSET) and 
            continuous professional development (CPD) to their PE workforce every five years, 
            which is considerably different from the annual interval recommended,” the report 
            added. <br><br>
