            When the pandemic was at its height, the uptake of ed-tech went into overdrive 
throughout India, with schools and colleges closing and disruption to learning calling for 
an immediate solution. With the world slowly getting back to normal, a concerning 
slump in the sector stood out starkly; a congested market of more than 4,500 start-ups, 
a harsh funding winter and rising customer acquisition expenses. Industry titans closed 
down, while others had to cut down en masse. <br><br>
These trends are a stark reminder of why ed-tech in India must reinvent itself and 
address issues that really concern the education system of the country.<mark>The time is 
opportune for sustainable, customer-focused businesses to make an impact but how? </mark> 
Personalised learning: Rural India harbors the majority of the country’s population and it 
has many obstacles to quality education. Along with the shortage of proper teaching 
resources, infrastructural deficiencies impede educational advancement. India is a 
nation with more mobile devices than desktops and laptops, and digital learning is an 
ever-present challenge. AI-based learning platforms can tackle these issues in 
numerous ways. From co-teaching tools for instructors to individualized study guides, 
AI can offer customized attention to students. Personalisation is scalable, as AI is able 
to understand the intent and advise individuals on courses they need to take and in 
what sequence. It identifies study areas most appropriate for people based on their 
interests and those which need to be improved. <br><br>
AI as assistant teachers: For schools, institutions and universities that are perpetually in 
need of funds to finance administrative and assistant work, AI-driven platforms can 
assist in carrying out assessments, creating lesson plans, taking over repetitive work 
and enabling teachers to have more time for student needs. Another area is employing 
online lessons with interactive gaming features, to facilitate increased retention and 
motivation. Most ed-tech firms are now adding regional languages to AI-powered 
platforms, helping to make education more accessible. This is what is required in order 
to democratise access to quality education. 
Challenges <br><br>
<em>Most Indians initially used the Internet via smartphones, not conventional tools such as 
laptops and desktops. With inexpensive Internet and smartphones becoming cheaper, 
India brought aboard hundreds of millions of new Internet users within only the past 
half-decade. There is also a digital divide between urban and rural that remains. The 
challenge thus resides in crafting great, bespoke learning experiences within a mobile 
phone at scale while optimising for consistent experience across devices and operating 
systems. </em><br><br>
The sheer nexus of complexity of different learning needs and multiple types of learners 
and learning modes is also a challenge. Ed-tech platform vendors are left with hundreds 
or thousands of customized courses that they will need to maintain rather than one 
source of content or tests. Personalization involves optimized AI engines that can 
handle thousands of courses that are customized to some extent. This can be resolved 
using generative AI that is able to read textbooks, story content and quizzes to deliver 
real-time individualised experiences to a teacher or student without having to alter the 
platform. 
In the midst of the funding winter, India’s ed-tech space needs to rethink itself. 
Dedicated effort towards balancing its AI empowerment agenda with the nation’s 
developmental agenda is called for in addressing India’s burning issues in its education 
system as well as enable the industry to keep pace with India’s mission of making a 
technologically-equipped workforce in India. <br>
