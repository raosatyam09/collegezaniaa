        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ0Aom8Q-KDDslfSq18ngB6gpj0JygcLfisuA&s" alt="UGC" class="fade-in">

            With the current public discourse over the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) new 
            initiatives to revolutionize the higher education system in India, the key question is: Do 
            we stick to the Western model that originally influenced our universities, build a 
            framework based on our own traditional learning processes, or establish a hybrid model 
            combining the best of both to address local and international needs? 
            <em> As is well understood, Western higher education models focus heavily on research that 
                adds to the knowledge of society. This model encourages cooperation among socially
                oriented agencies and university departments in collaboration to solve problems, spur 
                innovation, and create new knowledge. Indian universities, </em>
                 with the enormous numbers 
            of students pursuing degrees mainly as a means to guarantee a job, tend to put 
            research in the backseat. While the UGC has brought in a number of regulations to 
            make PhD programmes more streamlined, developing a robust research culture is still a 
            relatively new task for us. <br><br>
            Considering the UGC’s interest in improving the standards of higher education in our 
            nation, it would be best if it took suggestions from experts in the field. Some of the 
            important observations are as follows: 
            Safeguarding academic freedom is essential to maintain transparency and promote 
            development. Transparency entails that the appointments of vice chancellors and 
            registrars should be free from any monetary influence; these roles should be given 
            purely on the basis of academic success, administrative experience, and the vision the 
            candidates can contribute to their potential roles. If appointments are based on money, 
            the very concept of “quality” in higher education loses all meaning. 
            One of the common problems in our higher education system is political intervention at 
            local, state, and central levels in key areas like faculty recruitment, syllabus 
            formulation, and research grants. These are severely weakening the system. Frequently, 
            the ruling party prescribes what can and cannot be taught. Equally, the research topics 
            get funded in preference by those who hold power over their desired preferences, 
            instead of providing the principal investigators with the intellectual autonomy to 
            research areas of their own interest. Equally, we constantly hear about the impact of 
            money and influence on the recruitment and promotions of the faculty. Without tackling 
            these long-standing problems, higher education will forever remain a far-fetched dream 
            of becoming excellent. 
            The most important element that must be confronted in our higher education system is 
            quality, not the undue focus we tend to give to quantity. Higher education should be for 
            those with a legitimate academic interest in acquiring knowledge. Academic degrees 
            should not merely be a job requirement. What we learn and what we actually do 
            professionally often bear little relationship. More often than not, we develop industry
            specific skills based on hands-on experience upon employment and not upon what we 
            know from schools and colleges. <br><br>
            Our education system largely fails in bridging the gap between classroom learning and 
            real-world application. One of the biggest mistakes we, as a society, continue to make is 
            equating academic degrees with job eligibility. This mindset has significantly restricted 
            the true purpose of higher education — pursuing research. Consequently, research is 
            often seen as just another degree to be earned, rather than as a rigorous intellectual 
            pursuit aimed at generating new knowledge. 

            <mark> Quantifying a research degree as an essential qualification for the selection of teaching 
                positions has hugely watered down the integrity of our research programmes. Real 
                research is an inductive and discretionar</mark>y activity that demands full-time devotion, 
            strict compliance with stringent guidelines, and, finally, the creation of new 
            understanding and knowledge in the selected area. 
            Last but not least, in order to improve India’s higher education system, the UGC should 
            contemplate adopting a number of key steps. These involve implementing research
            based evaluations, promoting interdisciplinary learning and critical thinking, and 
            minimizing use of contract faculty through investments in permanent recruitment and 
            development. Encouraging research on Indian literature and philosophy, enhancing 
            community outreach, and maintaining a balance between work and life for faculty and 
            students are also crucial. Compulsory counselling facilities need to be initiated to aid 
            student welfare, while universities need to work with policymakers to combat issues of 
            healthcare, education, and climate change. Providing more autonomy to students to 
            choose courses, incorporating new areas such as Artificial Intelligence and promoting 
            student start-ups with university facilitation are also important. All these should be an 
            integral part of the UGC’s strategic vision to revolutionize higher education in India.
